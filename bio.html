		<h1> I'm Akshi! </h1>
		<h2> Where I come from... </h2>
		<p> I was born in Bangalore, India and lived there till I was six years old.  When I was six, I moved to Doha, Qatar and lived there for the short period of 6 months. I then moved back to India, but this time to Chennai - where both my parents are from. As you can see I was traveling a lot in my childhood, but at the age of 7 I moved to Singapore and I stayed there until I graduated from high school! </p>
		<h2> Professional Life </h2>
		<p>I am currently a senior at Tufts University majoring in General Psychology and minoring in Computer Science. I am interested in studying psychopathology, and I hope to pursue a career in clinical psychology following graduation. I am interested in the development of computer-based interventions and techniques for mental disorders. I currently intern at a cognitive neuroscience lab at Boston Children's Hospital on <a href= "http://www.childrenshospital.org/research-and-innovation/research/labs/laboratories-of-cognitive-neuroscience/current-research-projects/autism-research-program/games-project">a project</a> that is testing whether specially designed computer games can improve executive functioning in children with autism spectrum disorders. After I graduate, I plan on working in a psychology research lab for a year before applying to Clinical Psychology Ph.D programs.</p>
